# landing-page
Landing Page to use for your website.

A landing page which is made easy to use in different grids and columns.
It exists out of divs and is made so it can function within mobile screens.
  
The resolution adapts itself and can be seen at the bottom within the @media screen function which 
is derived in two sections in the css file.

The main purpose of this page is you can edit it how you can and paly with it how much you want.
Of course if you are a beginner and don't know where to begin you can use this template to play
around with.

#hamburger icon
It shows itself when the screen resolution is below 500px/41em. It is a clickable dropdown, which
has different sections such as PageA and PageB that are linked to the landing page. So we made
a one page layout with different screen sections.

#footer
Footer is adapted at the lower screen resolution so it can be viewed within the regular view 
instead outside of it.

Nothing more to write about it for now.
